Niagara is a particle effects processing system for Unreal Engine. In Niagara System, we can freely choose and combine various modules to realize the desired particle behaviors and effects.

The theme of this project is the design of music visualization effect based on Niagara, I chose fire as the main theme and created two kinds of particle effects for practice.
