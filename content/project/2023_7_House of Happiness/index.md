"Hospice care is a service to prevent and alleviate the suffering of terminally ill patients and their families, and to improve their quality of life before death. It advocates active decision-making and close contact with family members. It is an end-of-life process that gives meaning to life in the process of living in peace and happiness.

We wanted to visualize what people want in a simple way, so for the main body of the game we wanted to bring the player and the characters closer together through first-person conversations and interactions.
