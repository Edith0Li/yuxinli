We have observed in our lives that noise problems are prevalent in shared living environments such as apartments and dormitories. And our survey found that despite the prevalence of such problems, people are often troubled by the social and communication stress caused by noise. For example, they are unable to identify exactly where the noise that bothers them is coming from, and they are unable to come up with a basis for communicating with their neighbors.

In order to solve these problems, my team and I designed a hardware and software system that measures the noise level in a room through sensors, uploads the data to a back-end and connects it to a database and a mobile app, so that the data can be shared among all the rooms in an apartment, which will hopefully give residents a communication platform and data support to reasonably solve the noise problem.
