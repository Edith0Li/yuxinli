In China, the vast majority of people live in apartment houses, and according to the group members and my survey of students and friends, noise is a very common problem in such dense living environments. Not only are people likely to be bothered by noise, but they also have problems communicating with their neighbors when addressing noise issues.

We have designed a system that detects the volume in a room through multiple sensors and uploads the measurement data to the backend of a telephone program to be shared in the same living area. Users can send alerts to other residents who are making noise through the mobile program, and the measured data can also be used as evidence for communication.
