My classmates complained to me that when practicing some posture-demanding sports such as pull-ups alone, they often face the problem of having no one to check their postures. Therefore, my group and I chose a convolutional neural network dedicated to human posture estimation called BlazePose, which allows for the recognition of athletic postures for counting and motion detection. We also connected it with a mobile application that can help users exercise independently.
