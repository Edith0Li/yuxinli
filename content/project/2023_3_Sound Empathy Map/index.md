Hearing loss is a very common disability, yet we tend to characterize Deaf people as a whole as "unable to hear" rather than getting a more accurate picture of what they are really like. It is difficult to empathize with them, and more often than not, it is difficult to even communicate with them.

In order to give people a sense of their living conditions, I used a mixture of ink colors to symbolize the integration of the two groups of people, simulated the vibration of the water surface to reflect the sound, and interviewed the hearing impaired people to summarize the emotional experience with them and expressed them in colors.

Participants in this interactive space will experience the psychological and sensory experiences of the hearing impaired (water vibrations simulated on the ground, murmurs, spatial variations in frequency), and sound sensors will capture the sounds they produce while symbolizing the process of mutual understanding through the blending of colors. Participants can walk around the interactive space, making physical movements while seeing images on the screen that follow the movement, while showing a real-time ink blur effect.
