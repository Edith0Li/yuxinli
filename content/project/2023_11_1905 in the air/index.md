This project is inspired by my personal experience. I love music and stage performances and enjoy the interaction between performer and audience, but I find that concerts are more homogenous than others. There is also a certain barrier to understanding the music for most audiences. I want to create an immersive scenario where the effect of the performance resonates more with the listener or viewer.

I chose one of my favorite symphonies for this scenography project, the Eleventh Symphony is a new kind of title symphony, and I think its strong images and storytelling make it the best ingredient for an immersive space.
