I am Yuxin (Edith) Li, an undergraduate student at the School of Digital Media and Design Arts, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. My major is Digital Media Technology.
I am a digital music composer and sound designer, and was a percussionist in the Symphonic and Wind Ensemble of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. My dream is to explore the possibilities of combining technology and music. I have a broad interest in music acoustics, chamber acoustics, music interaction and sound engineering.
